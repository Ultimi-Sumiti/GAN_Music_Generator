# Outputs
Inside this directory you can find:
- In `checkpoints`: some checkpoints of the models trained on different datasets.
- In `songs`: some ouputs produced by the models.
Note that the reported songs were not generated only with the models that you can load using the checkpoints.

## Songs
In the following we report the ouputs inside the `songs` directory so you can listen to them direclty here without downloading the files.
Also, in the video, you can visualize the piano roll of the melody.
